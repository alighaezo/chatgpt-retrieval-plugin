If you want to install Windows 7 SP1 on your PC, you should follow the official instructions from Microsoft[^1^]. There are two ways to install Windows 7 SP1: using Windows Update or downloading and installing it manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog.
 
Using Windows Update is the easiest and recommended way to install Windows 7 SP1. If your PC is set to automatically install updates, youâll be prompted by Windows Update to install SP1. Follow the instructions to install the update. To manually install SP1 from Windows Update, select the Start button > All programs > Windows Update. In the left pane, select Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer. If you see a message telling you that important updates are available, or telling you to review important updates, select the message to view and select the important updates to install. In the list of updates, select Service Pack for Microsoft Windows (KB976932), and then select OK. Select Install updates. Follow the instructions on your screen.
 
Downloading and installing Windows SP1 from the Microsoft Update Catalog is another way to install Windows 7 SP1. However, this method requires an Internet connection and some technical skills. To download and install Windows SP1 from the Microsoft Update Catalog, go to the [Windows 7 Service Pack 1 download page](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB976932) on the Microsoft website. Select either the 32-bit (x86) or the 64-bit (x64) version of SP1 depending on whether youâre running the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Windows 7, and then select Add. To find out which version youâre running, select Start > right-click Computer > select Properties. Under System type, see if youâre running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows. After you have selected all of the files that apply to your system, select View Basket. Select Download and save all files in a single folder on your computer. After you have downloaded all files that apply to your system type, double-click each file in turn to install them.
 
After you have installed Windows 7 SP1, you will need to activate your Windows license using a valid product key. You can find your product key on a sticker attached to your PC or on a certificate of authenticity (COA) that came with your PC or installation disc. To activate your Windows license, select Start > right-click Computer > select Properties > select Activate Windows now. Follow the instructions on your screen.
 
If you have any problems installing or activating Windows 7 SP1, you can contact Microsoft Support for assistance.
