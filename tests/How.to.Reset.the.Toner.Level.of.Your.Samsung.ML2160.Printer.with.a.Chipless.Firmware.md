# How to Reset the Toner Level of Your Samsung ML-2160 Printer with a Chipless Firmware
 
If you have a Samsung ML-2160 printer, you may have encountered the problem of running out of toner and having to replace the cartridge before you can print again. This can be frustrating and costly, especially if you only need to print in black and white. Fortunately, there is a way to reset the toner level of your printer and make it ignore the chip on the cartridge that tells it how much toner is left. This is done by installing a chipless firmware on your printer, which will make it always see the toner level as 100%, regardless of the actual amount.

A chipless firmware is a modified version of the original firmware that comes with your printer. It bypasses the chip on the cartridge and allows you to print without any restrictions. You can find chipless firmware for various models of Samsung printers on [INKCHIP.NET](https://inkchip.net), a company that specializes in chipless solutions for printers. They also provide instructions and support for installing the firmware on your printer.
 
To reset the toner level of your Samsung ML-2160 printer with a chipless firmware, you will need the following:
 
- A computer with Windows operating system
- A USB cable to connect your printer to your computer
- The chipless firmware file for your printer model, which you can download from [INKCHIP.NET](https://inkchip.net)
- The usbprns2.exe program, which you can download from [ORPYS](https://orpys.com/en/content/135-samsung-ml-2160-firmware)

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Connect your printer to your computer with the USB cable and turn it on. Wait until the printer is ready and Windows finishes searching for drivers.
2. Run the usbprns2.exe program as administrator. You will see a window with a list of connected printers.
3. Select your printer from the list and click on "Open file". Browse to the folder where you saved the chipless firmware file and select it.
4. Click on "Send file". The program will start flashing the firmware to your printer. Do not turn off or disconnect your printer during this process.
5. When the flashing is done, you will see a message saying "Download complete". Close the program and turn off your printer.
6. Remove or cover the chip on your toner cartridge with tape or glue. This will prevent the printer from reading the chip and showing an error message.
7. Insert the toner cartridge back into your printer and turn it on. Your printer should now show the toner level as 100% and allow you to print without any problems.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset the toner level of your Samsung ML-2160 printer with a chipless firmware. You can now enjoy printing without worrying about running out of toner or replacing cartridges. If you need more information or assistance, you can contact [INKCHIP.NET](https://inkchip.net) or watch some videos on YouTube that show how to do this process.
